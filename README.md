#Listening Room Add-ons

This is an extension for Chrome that adds some extra features to Listening Room (http://listeningroom.net) such as scrobbling to Last.fm and a few GUI improvements.

If you just want to install the extension then you can do this by going to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hddgmojlgpifchcaiabidcopfkodpdjk. The only reason you need to download it from here is if you would like to fix an issue or add a new feature.

The extension itself is in the "extension" folder, while other resources are in the "docs" folder. To run the extension in Chrome go to chrome://extensions/, select "Load unpacked extension..." and select the "extension" folder.
